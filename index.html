            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>Thank you for coming to visit my website. What brings you here? </p>
            <p>Maybe you’ve come here because you feel sad or low, like somehow your life isn’t working out for you.
                Perhaps you been through some painful life changes here lately - a divorce, you’ve lost your job, or
                someone you love has died. Some come here because they feel haunted by the echoes of their past: unkind
                parents, fights with brothers and sisters, bullied at school, painful breakups. Sadly, many have
                experience horrible, unimaginable traumas. </p>
            <p>Maybe, just maybe, it’s even worse and you’ve wondered whether you even want to be alive. </p>
            <p>Let’s face it, life can be really, really cruel sometimes. </p>
            <p><em>It can help to have the right person on your team. </em></p>
            <p>My name is Gregg Unterberger, and for the last twenty years or so, I have worked as a license
                professional counselor, helping people just like you. </p>
            <p>You really don’t have to do this alone, you know? </p>
            <p>As a counselor, I practice a form of therapy called <em>systematic eclecticism</em>. I know, a real
                mouthful, right? All that means is I am trained in a broad number of orientations. I have lots and lots
                of tools in my toolkit, not just one or two, so I can tailor my approach <em>especially for you! </em>
            </p>
            <p>I have band-aids for broken hearts, bad moods and anxious minds that can begin to help right away! And I
                practice powerful therapies that may resolve trauma and horrible childhood memories more quickly than
                traditional blah-blah-blah talk therapy…a few of the technologies I have pioneered myself. I actually
                lecture internationally on many of my techniques. </p>
            <p>My clients tell me they like me because I do my work with my head AND my heart. I really try to listen
                and understand. And I think humor has a role to play in healing, too. </p>
            <p>I have had offices in both College Station and Georgetown (North Austin) Texas, for years. But since we
                are in the middle of a pandemic, I see my clients exclusively online on a secure, encrypted confidential
                platform for now. </p>
            <p>For my new clients I offer a “risk-free” initial hour-long appointment: If you don’t feel like I am a
                good fit for your needs (or don’t like my beard, lol) you won’t pay a dime and we will shake hands and
                part friends. You literally have nothing to lose but a few minutes of your time. </p>
            <div><span>Thanks for stopping by! Cruise the website for my bio to find out more about me, my book, THE
                    QUICKENING, and/or check out my upcoming national events page. Feel free to call my office at (512)
                    451-9527 and leave a message. If I can’t pick up, and I will be happy to return your call and answer
                    questions or schedule an appointment! Or feel free to contact me through the website
